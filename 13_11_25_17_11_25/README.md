**This Activity is for Model Validation and Testing**

Population data is extracted from "https://www.macrotrends.net/global-metrics/countries/gbr/united-kingdom/population"

1. 'Fitting_Forecasting_Activity.py' includes code with polynomial orders from 1 to 9 (13_11_25)

2. fitting_forecasting_chi.py' is code finding the chi-squared values plotted on gragh: χ² per Degree of Freedom for Polynomial Fits (13_11_25)

3. 'fitting_forecast_model_selection.py' is the final code for this activity. It includes the 3 polynomial fits: 3, 5, 9. Underfitting, Best Fit, Overfitting (13_11_25)

4. 'fitting_forecast_bic.py' is model selection code for BIC calculation (17_11_25)
